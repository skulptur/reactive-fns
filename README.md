Tiny and powerful functional reactive programming library for Typescript.

## Motivation

This library is based on the brilliant Callbag spec by AndrÃ© Staltz, which allows to create both pullable and listenable sources from simple functions. That makes it extremely lightweight and flexible. Because it is tiny it shines when used as a primitive for libraries or apps!

## Get started

Install

```bash
npm install --save reactive-fns
# or
yarn add reactive-fns
```

Use

```typescript
import { tap, interval, map, forEach, pipe, filter } from 'reactive-fns'

pipe(
    interval(1000),
    tap(v => console.log('Before: ' + v)),
    map(x => x * 3),
    filter(x => x % 2 === 0),
    forEach(v => console.log('After: ' + v))
)
```

### Source Creators

- fromEvent: Listen to DOM event.
- fromPromise: Converts a promise to a callbag.
- interval: Emits an increasing number at given intervals.
- of: Convert static value(s) to a callbag.

### Operators

- debounce: Debounces incoming values.
- filter: Filters incoming values.
- flatten: Flattens higher-order callbags.
- map: Transforms incoming values.
- scan: Combine consecutive values from source.
- share: Multicast source.
- skip: Ignores the first n of the source.
- startWith: Start with given values.
- take: Take a maximum number of values from source.

### Combinators

- concat: Combine sources by putting one source after the previous source ends.
- merge: Merges given callbags, emitting when each one emits.
- combine: Combines given callbags, emits arrays of latest values of each.

### Utilities

- forEach: Subscribes to given callbag.
- log: Shortcut for console.log in a forEach.
- pipe: Pipes sources to operators to sinks.
- tap: Taps into given callbag.
