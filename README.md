Tiny and powerful functional reactive programming library for Typescript.

## Motivation

This library is based on the brilliant Callbag spec by AndrÃ© Staltz, which allows to create both pullable and listenable sources from simple functions. That makes it extremely lightweight and flexible. Because it is tiny it shines when used as a primitive for libraries or apps!

## Get started

Install

```bash
npm install --save reactive-fns
# or
yarn add reactive-fns
```

Use

```typescript
import { tap, interval, map, forEach, pipe, filter } from 'reactive-fns'

pipe(
    interval(1000),
    tap(v => console.log('Before: ' + v)),
    map(x => x * 3),
    filter(x => x % 2 === 0),
    forEach(v => console.log('After: ' + v))
)
```
